SST merged Hadley Center-NOAA/OI data set
=========================================

Description
-----------
The merged Hadley-OI sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice
concentration (SIC) data sets were specifically developed as surface
forcing data sets for AMIP style uncoupled simulations of the Community
Atmosphere Model (CAM). The Hadley Centre's SST/SIC version 1.1
(HADISST1), which is derived gridded, bias-adjusted in situ observations,
were merged with the NOAA-Optimal Interpolation (version 2; OI.v2)
analyses. The HADISST1 spanned 1870 onward but the OI.v2, which started
in November 1981, better resolved features such as the Gulf Stream and
Kuroshio Current which are important components of the climate system.
Since the two data sets used different development methods, anomalies
from a base period were used to create a more homogeneous record. Also,
additional adjustments were made to the SIC data set.
