## This file contains the default values of all possible configuration options
## used to run analysis tasks.  Do not modify options in this file direct.
## Instead, follow this procedure:
##  1. Create and empty config file (say config.myrun) or copy one of the
##     example files in the configs directory.
##  2. Copy and modify any config options you want to change from this file into
##     into your new config file. Make sure they have the right section name
##     (e.g. [run] or [output]). If nothing esle, you will need to set
##     baseDirectory under [output] to the folder where output should be stored.
##  3. run: ./run_analysis.py config.myrun.  This will read the configuraiton
##     first from this file and then replace that configuraiton with any
##     changes from from config.myrun
##  4. If you want to run a subset of the analysis, you can either set the
##     generate option under [output] in your config file or use the
##     --generate flag on the command line.  See the comments for 'generate'
##     in the '[output]' section below for more details on this option.
