timeSeriesOceanRegions
======================

An analysis task for plotting time series of of temperature, salinity,
potential density and other fields of interest averaged over ocean regions.

Component and Tags::

  component: ocean
  tags: timeSeries, regions

Configuration Options
---------------------

The following configuration options are available for this task::

  [timeSeriesOceanRegions]
  ## options related to plotting time series of groups of ocean regions

  # the names of region groups to plot, each with its own section below
  regionGroups = ['Antarctic Regions']


  [timeSeriesAntarcticRegions]
  ## options related to plotting time series of Antarctic regions

  # An identifying string that is the prefix for a geojson file containing
  # Antarctic ocean regions.  Each region must have 'zmin' and 'zmax' properties
  # in addition to the usual properties for a region in geometric_features.  The
  # string is also used as the suffix for mask files generated from the geojson
  regionMaskSuffix = 'antarcticRegions20200621'

  # list of regions to plot or ['all'] for all regions in the masks file.
  # See "regionNames" in the antarcticRegions masks file in
  # regionMaskSubdirectory for details.
  regionNames = ['all']

  # a list of variables to plot
  variables = [{'name': 'temperature',
                'title': 'Temperature',
                'units': '$^\circ$C',
                'mpas': 'timeMonthly_avg_activeTracers_temperature'},
               {'name': 'salinity',
                'title': 'Salinity',
                'units': 'PSU',
                'mpas': 'timeMonthly_avg_activeTracers_salinity'},
               {'name': 'potentialDensity',
                'title': 'Potential Density',
                'units': 'kg m$^{-3}$',
                'mpas': 'timeMonthly_avg_potentialDensity'}]


Region Groups
-------------

A list of groups of regions, each of which will get its own gallery group on
the resulting analysis webpage.  These can be any name without punctuation.
For each region group, there should be a corresponding
``timeSeries<RegionGroup>`` section of the config file, with any spaces removed
from the name of the region group.  By default, the only region group is
"Antarctic Regions".

Region Mask
-----------

The ``regionMaskSuffix`` is a prefix for a geojson file produce from the
``geometric_features`` package and documented in the ``preprocess_masks``
directory of the GitHub repo.  It should include any number of ocean regions,
each of which includes properties ``zmin`` and ``zmax``.  Examples of how to
create such a set of features can be found in `antarctic_ocean_regions`_.

Region Names
------------

The ``regionNames`` can be set to ``['all']`` (the default) to plot all of the
regions in the geojson file.  In the case of "Antarctic Regions", these
are::

  ["Southern Ocean", "Southern Ocean 60S", "Eastern Weddell Sea Shelf",
   "Eastern Weddell Sea Deep", "Western Weddell Sea Shelf",
   "Western Weddell Sea Deep", "Weddell Sea Shelf", "Weddell Sea Deep",
   "Bellingshausen Sea Shelf", "Bellingshausen Sea Deep", "Amundsen Sea Shelf",
   "Amundsen Sea Deep", "Eastern Ross Sea Shelf", "Eastern Ross Sea Deep",
   "Western Ross Sea Shelf", "Western Ross Sea Deep",
   "East Antarctic Seas Shelf", "East Antarctic Seas Deep"]


Variables
---------

The ``variables`` list has a python dictionary for each variable to be plotted.
A separate gallery will be produced for each variable with a title given by
the ``"title"`` entry in the dictionary.  The ``"units"`` entry is used for the
y-axis label of each plot.  The ``"name"`` is the name of the variable in
the NetCDF files as well as the text appended to subtaks names and file names.
It should contain no spaces.  The ``"mpas"`` entry is the name of the
corresponding field in the MPAS-Ocean ``timeSeriesStatsMonthlyOutput`` files.
