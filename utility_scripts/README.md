To use these utilities, either move them up one directory or make a symlink to
`../mpas_analysis` here.

Utilities for remapping are now in the [pyremap repo](https://github.com/MPAS-Dev/pyremap/tree/master/examples).

Currently the only utility, `make_region_mask.py`, is for efficiently creating
region mask files for later use by MPAS-Analysis or other MPAS components or
tools.
