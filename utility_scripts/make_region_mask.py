'''
Creates a region mask file from a geojson file defining the regions and a mesh
file.  The geojson file should be in the diagnostics/mpas_analysis/region_masks
directory and the mask file will be stored in the same directory, saving the
time of computing the mask for each analysis run.  Because mask computation
with shapely is relatively slow, the computation can be sped up by running
several threads in parallel.

Usage: Copy this script into the main MPAS-Analysis directory (up one level).
Modify the mesh and regions names and the local path to region masks.
Optionally, change the number of threads.
