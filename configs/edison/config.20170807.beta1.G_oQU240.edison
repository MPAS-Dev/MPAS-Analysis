[runs]
## options related to the run to be analyzed and reference runs to be
## compared against

# mainRunName is a name that identifies the simulation being analyzed.
mainRunName = 20170807.beta1.G_oQU240.edison
# preprocessedReferenceRunName is the name of a reference run that has been
# preprocessed to compare against (or None to turn off comparison).  Reference
# runs of this type would have preprocessed results because they were not
# performed with MPAS components (so they cannot be easily ingested by
# MPAS-Analysis)
preprocessedReferenceRunName = B1850C5_ne30_v0.4

[input]
## options related to reading in the results to be analyzed

# directory containing model results
baseDirectory = /scratch1/scratchdirs/xylar/acme_scratch/edison/G-QU240-master-intel/run

# names of ocean and sea ice meshes (e.g. EC60to30, QU240, RRS30to10, etc.)
mpasMeshName = oQU240v3

[output]
## options related to writing out plots, intermediate cached data sets, logs,
## etc.

# directory where analysis should be written
baseDirectory = /dir/to/analysis/output

# a list of analyses to generate.  Valid names are:
#   'timeSeriesOHC', 'timeSeriesSST', 'climatologyMapSST',
#   'climatologyMapSSS', 'climatologyMapMLD', 'streamfunctionMOC',
#   'indexNino34', 'meridionalHeatTransport',
#   'timeSeriesSeaIceAreaVol', 'climatologyMapSeaIceConcThick'
# the following shortcuts exist:
#   'all' -- all analyses will be run
#   'all_timeSeries' -- all time-series analyses will be run
#   'all_climatology' -- all analyses involving climatologies
#   'all_horizontalMap' -- all analyses involving horizontal climatology maps
#   'all_ocean' -- all ocean analyses will be run
#   'all_seaIce' -- all sea-ice analyses will be run
#   'no_timeSeriesOHC' -- skip 'timeSeriesOHC' (and similarly with the
#                             other analyses).
#   'no_ocean', 'no_timeSeries', etc. -- in analogy to 'all_*', skip the
#                                            given category of analysis
# an equivalent syntax can be used on the command line to override this
# option:
#    ./run_analysis.py config.analysis --generate \
#         all,no_ocean,all_timeSeries
generate = ['all']

# alternative examples that would perform all analysis except
#   'timeSeriesOHC'
#generate = ['all', 'no_timeSeriesOHC']
# Each subsequent list entry can be used to alter previous list entries. For
# example, the following would run all tasks that aren't ocean analyses,
# except that it would also run ocean time series tasks:
#generate = ['all', 'no_ocean', 'all_timeSeries']

[climatology]

## observations and previous runs

# The names of the mapping file used for interpolation.  If a mapping file has
# already been generated, supplying the absolute path can save the time of
# generating a new one.  If nothing is supplied, the file name is automatically
# generated based on the MPAS mesh name, the comparison grid resolution, and
# the interpolation method

[timeSeries]
## options related to producing time series plots, often to compare against
## observations and previous runs

# start and end years for timeseries analysis. Using out-of-bounds values

[index]
## options related to producing nino index.

# start and end years for the nino 3.4 analysis.  Using out-of-bounds values
