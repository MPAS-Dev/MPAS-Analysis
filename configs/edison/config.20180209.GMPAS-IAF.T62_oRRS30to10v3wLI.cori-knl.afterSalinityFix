#   'all_<component>' -- all analyses from a given component (either 'ocean'
#                        or 'seaIce') will be run

#                                       without the tag will be skipped
#   'no_<task_name>' -- skip the given task
#   'no_<component>', 'no_<tag>' -- in analogy to 'all_*', skip all analysis
