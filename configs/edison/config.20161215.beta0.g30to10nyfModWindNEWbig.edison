## compared against

# mainRunName is a name that identifies the simulation being analyzed.
mainRunName = 20161215.beta0.g30to10nyfModWindNEWbig.edison
# preprocessedReferenceRunName is the name of a reference run that has been
# preprocessed to compare against (or None to turn off comparison).  Reference
# runs of this type would have preprocessed results because they were not
# performed with MPAS components (so they cannot be easily ingested by
# MPAS-Analysis)

[input]
## options related to reading in the results to be analyzed

# directory containing model results
baseDirectory = /global/cscratch1/sd/sprice/acme-scratch/g30to10nyfModWindNEWbig

# names of ocean and sea ice meshes (e.g. EC60to30, QU240, RRS30to10, etc.)

[output]
## options related to writing out plots, intermediate cached data sets, logs,

# a list of analyses to generate.  Valid names are:
#   'timeSeriesOHC', 'timeSeriesSST', 'regriddedSST',
#   'regriddedSSS', 'regriddedMLD', 'timeSeriesSeaIceAreaVol',
#   'regriddedSeaIceConcThick'
# the following shortcuts exist:
#   'all' -- all analyses will be run
#   'all_timeSeries' -- all time-series analyses will be run
#   'all_regriddedHorizontal' -- all analyses involving regridded horizontal
#                                fields will be run
#   'all_ocean' -- all ocean analyses will be run
#   'all_seaIce' -- all sea-ice analyses will be run
#   'no_timeSeriesOHC' -- skip 'timeSeriesOHC' (and similarly with the
#                             other analyses).
#   'no_ocean', 'no_timeSeries', etc. -- in analogy to 'all_*', skip the
#                                            given category of analysis
# an equivalent syntax can be used on the command line to override this
# option:
#    ./run_analysis.py config.analysis --generate \
#         all,no_ocean,all_timeSeries
generate = ['all', 'no_timeSeriesOHC', 'no_timeSeriesSST', 'no_indexNino34',

#   'timeSeriesOHC'
#generate = ['timeSeriesSST', 'all_regriddedHorizontal', 'all_seaIce']

# example, the following would produce all analyses except regriddedSST,
# regriddedSSS and regriddedMLD (albeit not in a very intuitive way):
