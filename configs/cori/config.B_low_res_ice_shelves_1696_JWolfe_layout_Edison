## compared against

# mainRunName is a name that identifies the simulation being analyzed.
mainRunName = B_low_res_ice_shelves_1696_JWolfe_layout_Edison

# config file for a control run to which this run will be compared.  The
# analysis should have already been run to completion once with this config
# file, so that the relevant MPAS climatologies already exist and have been
# remapped to the comparison grid.  Leave this option commented out if no
# control run is desired.
# controlRunConfigFile = /path/to/config/file

# config file for a main run on which the analysis was already run to
# completion.  The relevant MPAS climatologies already exist and have been
# remapped to the comparison grid and time series have been extracted.
# Leave this option commented out if the analysis for the main run should be
# performed.
# mainRunConfigFile = /path/to/config/file

[execute]
## options related to executing parallel tasks

# the number of parallel tasks (1 means tasks run in serial, the default)
parallelTaskCount = 1

# Set this to "bck" (background parallelism) if running on a machine that can
# handle 12 simultaneous processes, one for each monthly climatology.

[diagnostics]
## config options related to observations, mapping files and region files used
## by MPAS-Analysis in diagnostics computations.

# The base path to the diagnostics directory.  Typically, this will be a shared
# directory on each E3SM supported machine (see the example config files for
# its location).  For other machines, this would be the directory pointed to
# when running "download_analysis_data.py" to get the public observations,
# mapping files and region files.
baseDirectory = /global/cfs/cdirs/e3sm/diagnostics

[input]
## options related to reading in the results to be analyzed

# directory containing model results
baseDirectory = /global/cscratch1/sd/fyke/ACME_simulations/B_low_res_ice_shelves_1696_JWolfe_layout_Edison/run

# names of ocean and sea ice meshes (e.g. EC60to30, QU240, RRS30to10, etc.)

# names of namelist and streams files, either a path relative to baseDirectory
# or an absolute path.

[output]
## options related to writing out plots, intermediate cached data sets, logs,
## etc.

# directory where analysis should be written

# portal)

# a list of analyses to generate.  Valid names can be seen by running:
#   mpas_analysis --list
# This command also lists tags for each analysis.
# Shortcuts exist to generate (or not generate) several types of analysis.
# These include:
#   'all' -- all analyses will be run
#   'all_<tag>' -- all analysis with a particular tag will be run
#   'all_<component>' -- all analyses from a given component (either 'ocean'
#                        or 'seaIce') will be run
#   'only_<component>', 'only_<tag>' -- all analysis from this component or
#                                       with this tag will be run, and all
#                                       analysis for other components or
#                                       without the tag will be skipped
#   'no_<task_name>' -- skip the given task
#   'no_<component>', 'no_<tag>' -- in analogy to 'all_*', skip all analysis
#                                   tasks from the given compoonent or with
#                                   the given tag.  Do
#                                      mpas_analysis --list
#                                   to list all task names and their tags
# an equivalent syntax can be used on the command line to override this
# option:
#    mpas_analysis config.analysis --generate \
#         all,no_ocean,all_timeSeries

[climatology]
## options related to producing climatologies, typically to compare against
## observations and previous runs

# the first year over which to average climatalogies
startYear = 91
# the last year over which to average climatalogies
endYear = 100

[timeSeries]
## options related to producing time series plots, often to compare against
## observations and previous runs

# start and end years for timeseries analysis. Use endYear = end to indicate
# that the full range of the data should be used.  If errorOnMissing = False,
# the start and end year will be clipped to the valid range.  Otherwise, out
# of bounds values will lead to an error.  In a "control" config file used in
# a "main vs. control" analysis run, the range of years must be valid and
# cannot include "end" because the original data may not be available.
startYear = 1
endYear = 10

[index]
## options related to producing nino index.

# start and end years for El Nino 3.4 analysis. Use endYear = end to indicate
# that the full range of the data should be used.  If errorOnMissing = False,
# the start and end year will be clipped to the valid range.  Otherwise, out
# of bounds values will lead to an error.  In a "control" config file used in
# a "main vs. control" analysis run, the range of years must be valid and
# cannot include "end" because the original data may not be available.

[streamfunctionMOC]
## options related to plotting the streamfunction of the meridional overturning
## circulation (MOC)

# Use postprocessing script to compute the MOC? You want this to be True
# for low-resolution simulations that use GM to parameterize eddies, because
# the online MOC analysis member currently does not include the bolus velocity
# in its calculation, whereas the postprocessing script does.
# NOTE: this is a temporary option that will be removed once the online
# MOC takes into account the bolus velocity when GM is on.
