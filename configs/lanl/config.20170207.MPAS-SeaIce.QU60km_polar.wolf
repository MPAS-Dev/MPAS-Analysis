# a list of analyses to generate.  Valid names can be seen by running:
#   mpas_analysis --list
# This command also lists tags for each analysis.
# Shortcuts exist to generate (or not generate) several types of analysis.
# These include:
#   'all' -- all analyses will be run
#   'all_<tag>' -- all analysis with a particular tag will be run
#   'all_<component>' -- all analyses from a given component (either 'ocean'
#                        or 'seaIce') will be run
#   'only_<component>', 'only_<tag>' -- all analysis from this component or
#                                       with this tag will be run, and all
#                                       analysis for other components or
#                                       without the tag will be skipped
#   'no_<task_name>' -- skip the given task
#   'no_<component>', 'no_<tag>' -- in analogy to 'all_*', skip all analysis
#                                   tasks from the given compoonent or with
