    <description>
      The merged Hadley-OI sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice
      concentration (SIC) data sets were specifically developed as surface
      forcing data sets for AMIP style uncoupled simulations of the Community
      Atmosphere Model (CAM). The Hadley Centre's SST/SIC version 1.1
      (HADISST1), which is derived gridded, bias-adjusted in situ observations,
      were merged with the NOAA-Optimal Interpolation (version 2; OI.v2)
      analyses. The HADISST1 spanned 1870 onward but the OI.v2, which started
      in November 1981, better resolved features such as the Gulf Stream and
      Kuroshio Current which are important components of the climate system.
      Since the two data sets used different development methods, anomalies
      from a base period were used to create a more homogeneous record. Also,
      additional adjustments were made to the SIC data set.

    <description>
      [NASA JPL AVISO website](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/AVISO_L4_DYN_TOPO_1DEG_1MO)
      This dataset contains absolute dynamic topography (similar to sea level
      but with respect to the geoid) binned and averaged monthly on 1 degree
      grids. The coverage is from October 1992 to December 2010. These data
      were provided by AVISO (French space agency data provider) to support the
      CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) under the World
      Climate Research Program (WCRP) and was first made available via the JPL
      Earth System Grid. The dynamic topography are derived from sea surface
      height measured by several satellites including Envisat, TOPEX/Poseidon,
      Jason-1 and OSTM/Jason-2, and referenced to the geoid. Along with this
      dataset, two additional ancillary data files are included in the same
      directory which contain the number of observations and standard error
      co-located on the same 1 degree grids.

      Argo Mixed Layer Depth (MLD) climatology
    </name>
    <component>
      ocean
    </component>
    <description>
      A mixed layer climatology and database (described in Holte et al. 2017)
      using Argo profiles and a hybrid method (Holte and Talley 2009) for
      finding the mixed layer depth (MLD). The climatology incorporates over
      1,385,000 Argo profiles (through February 2017). The new hybrid algorithm
      models the general shape of each profile, searches for physical features
      in the profile, and calculates threshold and gradient MLDs to assemble a
      suite of possible MLD values. It then analyzes the patterns in the suite
      to select a final MLD estimate. Results are also presented for MLDs
      calculated using de Boyer Montegut et al.'s (2004) threshold values.

      ocean
    </component>
    <description>
      The Trenbert and Caron oceanic meridional heat transport is computed
      by computation of energy balance of the atmosphere, adjusted to fit
      physical constraints, and using two reanalysis products: the National
      Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric
      Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis and the European Centre for Medium-Range
      Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) product. The analysis focuses on the period
      from February 1985 to April 1989 when there are reliable top-of-the-atmosphere
      radiation data from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment.

    <description>
      This new version of the Roemmich-Gilson Argo Climatology extends the
      analysis of Argo-only derived temperature and salinity fields through
      2016. Several marginal seas and the Artic Oean have been added. The
      analysis method is similar to what was descibed in the Progress In
      Oceanography Roemmich and Gilson paper (2009). The only modification has
      been to scale the zonal equatorial correlation of the optimal estimation
      step, by 8 times, versus 4 times as in the 2009 paper. The additional
      Argo data utilized in the analysis results in a longer monthly record as
      well as better estimates of the mean and variability fields. Monthly
      updates are available in between major yearly re-analyses.

      Hadley Centre's SST/SIC version 1.1 (HADISST1), which is derived gridded,
      bias-adjusted in situ observations, were merged with the NOAA-Optimal
      Interpolation (version 2; OI.v2) analyses. The HADISST1 spanned 1870
      onward but the OI.v2, which started in November 1981, better resolved
      features such as the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio Current which are important
      components of the climate system. Since the two data sets used different
      development methods, anomalies from a base period were used to create
      a more homogeneous record. Also, additional adjustments were made to
      the SIC data set.

    <description>
      The Nino 3.4 Index is also computed using the Extended Reconstructed
      Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST) dataset, which is a global monthly
      sea surface temperature dataset derived from the International Comprehensive
      Ocean-Atmosphere Dataset (ICOADS). It is produced on a 2 degree by 2 degree
      grid with spatial completeness enhanced using statistical methods. This
      monthly analysis begins in January 1854 continuing to the present and
      includes anomalies computed with respect to a 1971-2000 monthly climatology.
      The newest version of ERSST, version 4, is based on optimally tuned parameters
      using the latest datasets and improved analysis methods. ERSST is suitable
      for long-term global and basin-wide studies, and smoothed local and
      short-term variations are used in the dataset.

      This sea ice concentration data set was derived using measurements from
      the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) on the Nimbus-7
      satellite and from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) sensors on
      the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's (DMSP) -F8, -F11, and -F13
      satellites. Measurements from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder
      (SSMIS) aboard DMSP-F17 are also included. The data set has been
      generated using the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth
      Observing System (AMSR-E) Bootstrap Algorithm with daily varying
      tie-points. Daily (every other day prior to July 1987) and monthly data
      are available for both the north and south polar regions. Data are
      gridded on the SSM/I polar stereographic grid (25 x 25 km) and provided
      in two-byte integer format. Data are available via FTP.

    <description>
      The sea ice data presented here were derived from satellite
      passive-microwave radiometers, specifically, the Scanning Multichannel
      Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) on NASA's Nimbus 7 satellite, for November
      1978-August 1987, a sequence of Special Sensor Microwave Imagers (SSMIs)
      on the F8, F11, and F13 satellites of the Defense Meteorological
      Satellite Program (DMSP), for August 1987-December 2007, and the Special
      Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS) on the DMSP F17 satellite for
      January 2008-December 2012. The baseline data used were daily maps of
      sea ice concentration. The maps are polar stereographic projections with
      individual grid elements of approximately 25 km x 25 km; and the ice
      concentration data are also archived at the National Snow and Ice Data
      Center (NSIDC) at http://nsidc.org. The concentrations are calculated for
      each ocean grid element and are used to derive 'sea ice extent', which is
      calculated as the sum of all ocean elements having a sea ice
      concentration of at least 15%, and 'sea ice area', which is calculated as
      the sum over all ocean grid elements of the product of ice concentration
      and grid element area. The data sets provided here include the
      hemispheric totals and additionally the values for nine regions in the
      Arctic and five regions in the Antarctic. These regions are identified in
      Figures 1 and 2 respectively. Figures 3 and 4 provide plots of the trends
      in the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice extents, along with monthly
      deviations and 12-month running means. The monthly deviations are
      calculated by taking the individual month's ice extent/area and
      subtracting from it the average over the course of the data set of the
      extents/areas for that month.

      This data set provides measurements of sea ice freeboard and sea ice
      thickness for the Arctic region. The data were derived from measurements
      made by from the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat)
      Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) instrument, the Special Sensor
      Microwave/Imager (SSM/I), and climatologies of snow and drift of ice.

    <description>
      Sea Ice Volume is calculated using the Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and
      Assimilation System (PIOMAS, Zhang and Rothrock, 2003) developed at
      APL/PSC.  Anomalies for each day are calculated relative to the average
      over the 1979-2016 period for that day of the year to remove the annual
      cycle. The model mean annual cycle of sea ice volume over this period
      ranges from 28,000 km3 in April to 11,500 km3 in September.
