    <description>
      The merged Hadley-OI sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice
      concentration (SIC) data sets were specifically developed as surface
      forcing data sets for AMIP style uncoupled simulations of the Community
      Atmosphere Model (CAM). The Hadley Centre's SST/SIC version 1.1
      (HADISST1), which is derived gridded, bias-adjusted in situ observations,
      were merged with the NOAA-Optimal Interpolation (version 2; OI.v2)
      analyses. The HADISST1 spanned 1870 onward but the OI.v2, which started
      in November 1981, better resolved features such as the Gulf Stream and
      Kuroshio Current which are important components of the climate system.
      Since the two data sets used different development methods, anomalies
      from a base period were used to create a more homogeneous record. Also,
      additional adjustments were made to the SIC data set.

    <description>
      The World Ocean Atlas 2018 (WOA18) release July 2019 updates previous
      versions of the World Ocean Atlas to include approximately 3 million
      new oceanographic casts added to the World  Ocean  Database (WOD) since
      the previous release as well as renewed and updated quality control.
      Animal mounted pinniped temperature profiles have been added as a data
      source improving coverage in some high latitude areas. WOA18 includes
      analysis for temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and dissolved
      inorganic nutrients (only temperature and salinity are used in MPAS-Analysis
      as of Aug 2019). The atlas includes annual, seasonal, and monthly
      climatologies and related statistical fields. Annual fields are available
      for the full depth (0-5500 m), while monthly and seasonal fields are
      available for the upper 1500 m only. Climatologies are available on a 1deg
      regular grid and on a 0.25deg grid.

    <description>
      [NASA JPL AVISO website](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/AVISO_L4_DYN_TOPO_1DEG_1MO)
      This dataset contains absolute dynamic topography (similar to sea level
      but with respect to the geoid) binned and averaged monthly on 1 degree
      grids. The coverage is from October 1992 to December 2010. These data
      were provided by AVISO (French space agency data provider) to support the
      CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) under the World
      Climate Research Program (WCRP) and was first made available via the JPL
      Earth System Grid. The dynamic topography are derived from sea surface
      height measured by several satellites including Envisat, TOPEX/Poseidon,
      Jason-1 and OSTM/Jason-2, and referenced to the geoid. Along with this
      dataset, two additional ancillary data files are included in the same
      directory which contain the number of observations and standard error
      co-located on the same 1 degree grids.

      Argo Mixed Layer Depth (MLD) climatology

    <description>
      A mixed layer climatology and database (described in Holte et al. 2017)
      using Argo profiles and a hybrid method (Holte and Talley 2009) for
      finding the mixed layer depth (MLD). The climatology incorporates over
      1,385,000 Argo profiles (through February 2017). The new hybrid algorithm
      models the general shape of each profile, searches for physical features
      in the profile, and calculates threshold and gradient MLDs to assemble a
      suite of possible MLD values. It then analyzes the patterns in the suite
      to select a final MLD estimate. Results are also presented for MLDs
      calculated using de Boyer Montegut et al.'s (2004) threshold values.

    <description>
      The Trenbert and Caron oceanic meridional heat transport is computed
      by computation of energy balance of the atmosphere, adjusted to fit
      physical constraints, and using two reanalysis products: the National
      Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric
      Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis and the European Centre for Medium-Range
      Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) product. The analysis focuses on the period
      from February 1985 to April 1989 when there are reliable top-of-the-atmosphere
      radiation data from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment.

    <description>
      This new version of the Roemmich-Gilson Argo Climatology extends the
      analysis of Argo-only derived potential temperature and salinity fields
      through 2016. Several marginal seas and the Artic Oean have been added.
      The analysis method is similar to what was descibed in the Progress In
      Oceanography Roemmich and Gilson paper (2009). The only modification has
      been to scale the zonal equatorial correlation of the optimal estimation
      step, by 8 times, versus 4 times as in the 2009 paper. The additional
      Argo data utilized in the analysis results in a longer monthly record as
      well as better estimates of the mean and variability fields. Monthly
      updates are available in between major yearly re-analyses.

    <description>
      Nino 3.4 Index is computed from the Hadley-OI sea surface temperature
      (SST) and sea ice concentration (SIC) data set. This product was
      specifically developed as surface forcing data set for AMIP style
      uncoupled simulations of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM). The
      Hadley Centre's SST/SIC version 1.1 (HADISST1), which is derived gridded,
      bias-adjusted in situ observations, were merged with the NOAA-Optimal
      Interpolation (version 2; OI.v2) analyses. The HADISST1 spanned 1870
      onward but the OI.v2, which started in November 1981, better resolved
      features such as the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio Current which are important
      components of the climate system. Since the two data sets used different
      development methods, anomalies from a base period were used to create
      a more homogeneous record. Also, additional adjustments were made to
      the SIC data set.

    <description>
      The Nino 3.4 Index is also computed using the Extended Reconstructed
      Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST) dataset, which is a global monthly
      sea surface temperature dataset derived from the International Comprehensive
      Ocean-Atmosphere Dataset (ICOADS). It is produced on a 2 degree by 2 degree
      grid with spatial completeness enhanced using statistical methods. This
      monthly analysis begins in January 1854 continuing to the present and
      includes anomalies computed with respect to a 1971-2000 monthly climatology.
      The newest version of ERSST, version 4, is based on optimally tuned parameters
      using the latest datasets and improved analysis methods. ERSST is suitable
      for long-term global and basin-wide studies, and smoothed local and
      short-term variations are used in the dataset.

      WOCE
      ----
      The Hydrographic Programme of the international World Ocean Circulation
      Experiment (WOCE) was a comprehensive global hydrographic survey of
      physical and chemical properties, of unprecedented scope and quality, and
      represents the "state of the oceans" during the 1990s.

      The "Printed Atlas" is a copy of the published volume and contains full
      introductory text. The "Digital Atlas" presents the same graphical
      material, with additional properties and levels, ancillary data sets, and
      bibliographic material for each of the vertical sections.

      CCHDO
      -----
      The CCHDO's primary mission is to deliver the highest possible quality
      global CTD and hydrographic data to users. These data are a product of
      decades of observations related to the physical characteristics of ocean
      waters carried out during WOCE, CLIVAR and numerous other oceanographic
      research programs. Whenever possible we provide these data in three
      easy-to-use formats: WHP-Exchange (which we recommend for data
      submissions to the CCHDO), WOCE, and netCDF.

      Southern Ocean (90Â°S-45Â°S) conservative temperature and absolute salinity profiles compilation (OCEAN ICE D1.1)

      This profile compilation contains conservative temperature and absolute salinity profiles computed from ship CTD, Argo floats and seal-borne profilers in the Southern Ocean (90Â°S-45Â°S) since 1972, using the GSW toolbox. It provides with an opportunity to investigate the broad scale climatology of the Southern Ocean hydrography on and off the continental shelf and facilitate localized timeseries analysis of the variability across various timescales.

      The World Ocean Atlas (WOA) is a data product of the Ocean Climate
      Laboratory of the National Oceanographic Data Center. It consists of
      objectively analyzed climatological mean fields at 1 degree spatial
      resolution. The climatology is based on all data that are available from
      the early 1900s to present.

      The observation-based pCO2 fields were created using a 2-step neural
      network method extensively described and validated in Landschuetzer et
      al. 2013, 2014, 2016. The method first clusters the global ocean into
      biogeochemical provinces and in a second step reconstructs the non-liner
      relationship between CO2 driver variables and observations from the 4th
      release of the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCATv4, Bakker et al. 2016).
      This file contains the resulting monthly pCO2 fields at 1 x 1 deg resolution
      covering the global ocean with the exception of the Arctic Ocean and few
      marginal seas. The air-sea CO2 fluxes are computed from the air-sea CO2
      partial pressure difference and a bulk gas transfer formulation
      following Landschuetzer et al. 2013, 2014, 2016. Furthermore, the monthly
      climatology is created from the monthly average of the period 1985-2015.

        * Lat (1x317): latitude (degrees), 73S to 85N.
        * Up2bar (317x720): Zonal Velocity Variance, mean(u' ^2) (m^2/s^2).
        * Vp2bar (317x720): Meridional Velocity Variance, mean(v' ^2) (m^2/s^2).
        * rA (317x720): Variance ellipse semimajor axis (m^2/s^2).
        * rB (317x720): Variance ellipse semiminor axis (m^2/s^2).
        * angle (317x720): Orientation angle of variance ellipse (degrees, 0=east/west).
        * N (317x720): Number of drifter-days per square degree.

      Note that Up2bar+Vp2bar=rA+rB, which is twice the eddy kinetic energy.

      Wave Reanalysis: ERA5

    <component>
      ocean

    <description>
      ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 4 to 7 decades.
      Currently data is available from 1950, with Climate Data Store entries for 1950-1978 (preliminary back extension)
      and from 1959 onwards (final release plus timely updates, this page). ERA5 replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis.

      Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and
      consistent dataset using the laws of physics. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on
      the method used by numerical weather prediction centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF)
      a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new
      best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued.
      Reanalysis works in the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset
      spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts,
      so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the
      ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.

      ERA5 provides hourly estimates for a large number of atmospheric, ocean-wave and land-surface quantities.
      An uncertainty estimate is sampled by an underlying 10-member ensemble at three-hourly intervals.
      Ensemble mean and spread have been pre-computed for convenience.
      Such uncertainty estimates are closely related to the information content of the available
      observing system which has evolved considerably over time. They also indicate flow-dependent sensitive areas.
      To facilitate many climate applications, monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated too,
      though monthly means are not available for the ensemble mean and spread.

      ERA5 is updated daily with a latency of about 5 days (monthly means are available around the 6th of each month).
      In case that serious flaws are detected in this early release (called ERA5T), this data could be different
      from the final release 2 to 3 months later. In case that this occurs users are notified.

      The data set presented here is a regridded subset of the full ERA5 data set on native resolution.
      It is online on spinning disk, which should ensure fast and easy access.
      It should satisfy the requirements for most common applications.

      An overview of all ERA5 datasets can be found in this [article](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets).
      Information on access to ERA5 data on native resolution is provided in these [guidelines](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/How+to+download+ERA5).

      Data has been regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.25 degrees for the reanalysis and
      0.5 degrees for the uncertainty estimate (0.5 and 1 degree respectively for ocean waves).
      There are four main sub sets: hourly and monthly products, both on pressure levels
      (upper air fields) and single levels (atmospheric, ocean-wave and land surface quantities).

      The present entry is "ERA5 monthly mean data on single levels from 1959 to present".

      Wave Satelite Altimeter Observations: ESA Sea State Climate Change Initiative
    </name>
    <component>

    <description>
      The ESA Sea State Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project has produced global merged multi-sensor
      time-series of monthly gridded satellite altimeter significant wave height (referred to as Level 4 (L4) data)
      with a particular focus for use in climate studies.

      This dataset contains the Version 1.1 Remote Sensing Sea Surface Height product, gridded over a global
      regular cylindrical projection (1Â°x1Â° resolution), averaging valid and good measurements from all
      available altimeters on a monthly basis (using the L2P products also available).
      These L4 products are meant for statistics and visualization.

      This first version of the Sea State CCI products is inherited from the GlobWave project,
      building on experience and existing outputs. It extends and improves the GlobWave products,
      which were a post-processing over existing L2 altimeter agency products with additional filtering,
      corrections and variables. A major improvement consists in a new denoised sea surface height
      variable using Empirical Mode Decomposition, which was used as input to these monthly statistical fields.

      The altimeter data used in the Sea State CCI dataset v1.1 come from multiple satellite missions
      spanning from 1991 to 2018 (ERS-1, ERS-2, Topex, Envisat, GFO, CryoSat-2, Jason-1, Jason-2, Jason-3, SARAL).
      Many altimeters are bi-frequency (Ku-C or Ku-S) and only measurements in Ku band were used,
      for consistency reasons, being available on each altimeter but SARAL (Ka band).

      column, trans-basin fluxes of heat, mass and freshwater in the subpolar 
      North Atlantic. It consists of two legs: one extending from southern 
      Labrador to the southwestern tip of Greenland across the mouth of the 
      Labrador Sea (OSNAP West), and the second from the southeastern tip of 
      Greenland to Scotland (OSNAP East). The observing system also includes 
      subsurface floats (OSNAP Floats) in order to trace the pathways of 
      overflow waters in the basin and to assess the connectivity of currents 
      crossing the OSNAP line. The location of the OSNAP East and West legs 
      purposefully melds with a number of long-term observational efforts in 
      the North Atlantic: the Canadian repeat AR7W program in the Labrador 
      Sea; the German Labrador Sea western boundary array at 53Â°N; the 
      global Ocean Observatories Initiative node to be placed in the 
      southwestern Irminger Sea; the repeat A1E/AR7E hydrographic sections 
      across the Irminger and Iceland basins; and the Ellett line in the 
      Rockall region. Importantly, this observing system, in conjunction with 
      the RAPID/MOCHA array at 26ÂºN and the EU THOR/NACLIM program, will 
      provide a comprehensive measure of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning 
      Circulation (AMOC) and provide a means to evaluate intergyre 
      connectivity in the North Atlantic. OSNAP is a collaborative effort, 
      which includes several countries including US, Canada, China, France, 
      Germany, Netherlands and the UK.

      This sea ice concentration data set was derived using measurements from
      the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) on the Nimbus-7
      satellite and from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) sensors on
      the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's (DMSP) -F8, -F11, and -F13
      satellites. Measurements from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder
      (SSMIS) aboard DMSP-F17 are also included. The data set has been
      generated using the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth
      Observing System (AMSR-E) Bootstrap Algorithm with daily varying
      tie-points. Daily (every other day prior to July 1987) and monthly data
      are available for both the north and south polar regions. Data are
      gridded on the SSM/I polar stereographic grid (25 x 25 km) and provided
      in two-byte integer format. Data are available via FTP.

      The sea ice data presented here were derived from satellite
      passive-microwave radiometers, specifically, the Scanning Multichannel
      Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) on NASA's Nimbus 7 satellite, for November
      1978-August 1987, a sequence of Special Sensor Microwave Imagers (SSMIs)
      on the F8, F11, and F13 satellites of the Defense Meteorological
      Satellite Program (DMSP), for August 1987-December 2007, and the Special
      Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS) on the DMSP F17 satellite for
      January 2008-December 2012. The baseline data used were daily maps of
      sea ice concentration. The maps are polar stereographic projections with
      individual grid elements of approximately 25 km x 25 km; and the ice
      concentration data are also archived at the National Snow and Ice Data
      Center (NSIDC) at http://nsidc.org. The concentrations are calculated for
      each ocean grid element and are used to derive 'sea ice extent', which is
      calculated as the sum of all ocean elements having a sea ice
      concentration of at least 15%, and 'sea ice area', which is calculated as
      the sum over all ocean grid elements of the product of ice concentration
      and grid element area. The data sets provided here include the
      hemispheric totals and additionally the values for nine regions in the
      Arctic and five regions in the Antarctic. These regions are identified in
      Figures 1 and 2 respectively. Figures 3 and 4 provide plots of the trends
      in the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice extents, along with monthly
      deviations and 12-month running means. The monthly deviations are
      calculated by taking the individual month's ice extent/area and
      subtracting from it the average over the course of the data set of the
      extents/areas for that month.

      This data set provides measurements of sea ice freeboard and sea ice
      thickness for the Arctic region. The data were derived from measurements
      made by from the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat)
      Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) instrument, the Special Sensor
      Microwave/Imager (SSM/I), and climatologies of snow and drift of ice.

    <description>
      Sea Ice Volume is calculated using the Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and
      Assimilation System (PIOMAS, Zhang and Rothrock, 2003) developed at
      APL/PSC.  Anomalies for each day are calculated relative to the average
      over the 1979-2016 period for that day of the year to remove the annual
      cycle. The model mean annual cycle of sea ice volume over this period
      ranges from 28,000 km3 in April to 11,500 km3 in September.

    <description>
      This data set provides estimates of annual freshwater fluxes related to sea-ice formation from ocean freezing
      and snow-ice formation, sea-ice melting, lateral transport of sea ice in the Southern Ocean over the period
      1982 to 2008. It is derived from a mass balance calculation of local sea-ice volume change and divergence
      from satellite data and sea-ice reconstructions. The mass balance is calculated on a daily basis and fluxes are
      then integrated over the entire year, where a year is defined from March to February of the next year (i.e.
      from March 1982 to February 2009). This approach combines multiple products of sea-ice concentration
      (Cavalieri &amp; Parkinson, 2008; Comiso, 1986; Meier et al., 2013), sea-ice thickness (Kurtz &amp; Markus, 2012;
      Massonnet et al., 2013; Worby et al., 2008), and sea-ice drift (Fowler et al., 2013; Kwok 2005; Schwegmann
      et al., 2011). For a detailed description of the method see Haumann et al. (2016). The data set is derived to
      estimate large-scale (regional to basin-scale) fluxes on an annual basis. Our confidence is reduced on a grid
      cell basis, such as for single coastal polynyas, where the method and underlying data induce large, unknown
      uncertainties.

      Iceberg probabilities from the Altiberg dataset for small icebergs (less than 3km in length) detected by altimeters using the high resolution waveforms. The database is also available for other several altimeter mission (ERS-1, ERS-2, Jason-1, Jason-2, CryoSat-2, Topex, Envisat, AltiKa). A merged product combining all the available altimeters is also provided, which is used in MPAS-Analysis.
