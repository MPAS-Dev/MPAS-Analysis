This is an example analysis task to be used as a template for new tasks.
It should be copied into one of the component folders (`ocean`, `sea_ice`,
`land_ice`, etc.) and modified as needed.

Specific parts or variable names that need to be modified by the developer are
explicitly indicated. All the others are to be left unchanged.  Anything in
comments or docstrings in triangle brackets <> indicates that it needs to be
replaced with the appropriate variable name, text, etc. for the task.

Instructions for creating a new analysis task:
1. create a new task by copying this file to the appropriate folder (ocean,
   sea_ice, etc.) and modifying it as described below.  Take a look at
   mpas_analysis/shared/analysis_task.py for additional guidance.
2. note, no changes need to be made to mpas_analysis/shared/analysis_task.py
3. modify default.cfg (and possibly any machine-specific config files in
   configs/<machine>)
4. import new analysis task in mpas_analysis/<component>/__init__.py
5. add new analysis task to mpas_analysis/__main__.py under
   build_analysis_list:
      analyses.append(<component>.MyTask(config, myArg='argValue'))
   This will add a new object of the MyTask class to a list of analysis tasks
   created in build_analysis_list.  Later on in run_task, it will first
   go through the list to make sure each task needs to be generated
   (by calling check_generate, which is defined in AnalysisTask), then, will
   call setup_and_check on each task (to make sure the appropriate AM is on
   and files are present), and will finally call run on each task that is
   to be generated and is set up properly.

Don't forget to remove this docstring. (It's not needed.)

    # This function is the "constructor", which is called when you want to
    # create a new object from your class.  Typically, it will just store a few
    # useful pieces of information like the name of the task, the component and
    # maybe some tags describing the task.
    # Keep self and config arguments.
    # self is a way to access the object that the class MyTask is describing,
    #    letting you access member variables and methods (member functions of a
    #    class), as you will see in the examples below.  All methods in a
    #    python class start with the argument self, which is not included in
    #    the list of arguments when you call a method of an object (because it
    #    is always included automatically).
    # config is an mpas_tools.config.MpasConfigParser object that can be used
    #    to get configuration options stored in default.cfg or a custom config
    #    file specific to a given simulation.  See examples below or in
    #    existing analysis tasks.
    # myArg should either be modified or removed. An example might be if you
    #    changed "myArg" to be "fieldName" (probably with no default value).
    #    Then, you would store it in self.fieldName so you could access it
    #    later in the script (in setup_and_check, run, or one of your helper
    #    methods).  In this example, you would have:
    #        def __init__(self, config, fieldName):...
    #    and yu would then make a new task something like this:
    #        myTask = MyTask(config, fieldName='seaIceArea')
