WOA18 Temperature and Salinity Climatology
==========================================

Description
-----------
The World Ocean Atlas 2018 (WOA18) release July 2019 updates previous
versions of the World Ocean Atlas to include approximately 3 million
new oceanographic casts added to the World  Ocean  Database (WOD) since
the previous release as well as renewed and updated quality control.
Animal mounted pinniped temperature profiles have been added as a data
source improving coverage in some high latitude areas. WOA18 includes
analysis for temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and dissolved
inorganic nutrients (only temperature and salinity are used in MPAS-Analysis
as of Aug 2019). The atlas includes annual, seasonal, and monthly
climatologies and related statistical fields. Annual fields are available
for the full depth (0-5500 m), while monthly and seasonal fields are
available for the upper 1500 m only. Climatologies are available on a 1deg
regular grid and on a 0.25deg grid.
