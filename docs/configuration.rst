Configuration
=============

MPAS-Analysis is controlled through configuration files, which are customized
to point to different simulation results and to control how the output is
computed and displayed.  Several groups of configuration options are found
across a number of analysis tasks.

Examples of configuration files for various E3SM supported machines can be
found in the ``configs/`` folder or can be browsed on `GitHub`_.  The file
``config.example`` provides a list of the default values for the configuration
options that are most commonly modified.
