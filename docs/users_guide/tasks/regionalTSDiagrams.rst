Region Groups
-------------

A list of groups of regions, each of which will get its own gallery on
the resulting analysis web page.  See :ref:`config_region_groups` for
more information on the available region groups.  For each region group, there
should be a corresponding ``TSDiagramsFor<RegionGroup>`` section of the config
file, with any spaces removed from the name of the region group.  By default,
the only region group is ``'Ocean Basins'``.

Region Names
------------

The ``regionNames`` can be set to ``['all']`` to plot all of the
regions in the geojson file.  In the case of ``Antarctic Regions``, these
are:

.. code-block:: cfg

    ["Southern Ocean", "Southern Ocean 60S", "Eastern Weddell Sea Shelf",
     "Eastern Weddell Sea Deep", "Western Weddell Sea Shelf",
     "Western Weddell Sea Deep", "Weddell Sea Shelf", "Weddell Sea Deep",
     "Bellingshausen Sea Shelf", "Bellingshausen Sea Deep", "Amundsen Sea Shelf",
     "Amundsen Sea Deep", "Eastern Ross Sea Shelf", "Eastern Ross Sea Deep",
     "Western Ross Sea Shelf", "Western Ross Sea Deep",
     "East Antarctic Seas Shelf", "East Antarctic Seas Deep"]

For ``Ocean Basins``, they are:

.. code-block:: cfg

    ["Atlantic_Basin", "Pacific_Basin", "Indian_Basin", "Arctic_Basin",
     "Southern_Ocean_Basin", "Mediterranean_Basin", "Global Ocean",
     "Global Ocean 65N to 65S", "Global Ocean 15S to 15N"]

Diagram Type
------------

By default, a "volumetric" diagram is produced, where the volume of ocean water
in a region is binned in T and S space, and the volume of each bin is plotted.
This allows for more quantitative comparison with observation- and model-based
climatologies.

If ``diagramType`` is set to ``scatter``, a point cloud is plotted instead,
shaded by depth.  We anticipate that this will useful for plotting data sets
that are spatially scattered (e.g. the MEOP seal data), because each sample
does not correspond to a volume.  This type of diagram may also be helpful for
comparison with publications that use scatter plots.

For volumetric diagrams, two norms for the continuous color map are supported,
``linear`` and ``log``, with ``log`` being the default.  The range of the
colormap is is between zero and the maximum bin volume for ``linear`` and
between the minimum non-zero bin volume and the max for ``log``.  The min/max
bin volume is taken from the first panel containing the "main" MPAS-Ocean plot,
and the same color map range is used for all panels.

Bins and Contour Intervals
--------------------------
If ``diagramType = volumetric``, the number and spacing of potential
temperature and salinity bins is set in ``Tbins`` and ``Sbins``.  For
``diagramType = scatter``, ``Tbins`` and ``Sbins`` are used to make contour
plots of neutral density and are used to determine the bounds of the figure
in T/S space.  ``rhoInterval`` is the interval between contours of neutral
density.  ``zmin`` and ``zmax`` are the minimum and maximum depths (positive
up) of the ocean region.  If available (e.g. for "Antarctic Regions"), the
default is to read them from geojson file.

Observations
------------
The ``obs`` option contains a list of the names of observational data sets.
Currently, "SOSE" and "WOA18" are the only data sets available, but we
anticipate adding several additional data sets in the near future.

:ref:`sose`
:ref:`woa18_t_s`
