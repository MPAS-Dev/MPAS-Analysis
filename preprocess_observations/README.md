# Observations Preprocessing Scripts

This directory contains scripts for preprocessing observations.  To run the
scripts, copy them to the base directory (`..`), change the paths to the
original obsrevational data sets (see comments in each script for sources
of the relevant data) and run the script to perform preprocessing.  The
scripts typically compute climatologies and/or perform remapping to a
comparison grid.
