Description
-----------
Southern Ocean (90째S-45째S) conservative temperature and absolute salinity
profiles compilation (OCEAN ICE D1.1)

This profile compilation contains conservative temperature and absolute
salinity profiles computed from ship CTD, Argo floats and seal-borne
profilers in the Southern Ocean (90째S-45째S) since 1972, using the GSW
toolbox. It provides with an opportunity to investigate the broad scale
climatology of the Southern Ocean hydrography on and off the continental
shelf and facilitate localized timeseries analysis of the variability
across various timescales.
