ERS SSTv4 Nino 3.4 Index
========================

Description
-----------
The Nino 3.4 Index is also computed using the Extended Reconstructed
Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST) dataset, which is a global monthly
sea surface temperature dataset derived from the International Comprehensive
Ocean-Atmosphere Dataset (ICOADS). It is produced on a 2 degree by 2 degree
grid with spatial completeness enhanced using statistical methods. This
monthly analysis begins in January 1854 continuing to the present and
includes anomalies computed with respect to a 1971-2000 monthly climatology.
The newest version of ERSST, version 4, is based on optimally tuned parameters
using the latest datasets and improved analysis methods. ERSST is suitable
for long-term global and basin-wide studies, and smoothed local and
short-term variations are used in the dataset.
