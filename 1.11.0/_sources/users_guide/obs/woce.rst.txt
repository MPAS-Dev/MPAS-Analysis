WOCE sections
=============

Description
-----------
WOCE
----
The Hydrographic Programme of the international World Ocean Circulation
Experiment (WOCE) was a comprehensive global hydrographic survey of
physical and chemical properties, of unprecedented scope and quality, and
represents the "state of the oceans" during the 1990s.

The "Printed Atlas" is a copy of the published volume and contains full
introductory text. The "Digital Atlas" presents the same graphical
material, with additional properties and levels, ancillary data sets, and
bibliographic material for each of the vertical sections.

CCHDO
-----
The CCHDO's primary mission is to deliver the highest possible quality
global CTD and hydrographic data to users. These data are a product of
decades of observations related to the physical characteristics of ocean
waters carried out during WOCE, CLIVAR and numerous other oceanographic
research programs. Whenever possible we provide these data in three
easy-to-use formats: WHP-Exchange (which we recommend for data
submissions to the CCHDO), WOCE, and netCDF.
