The ``[hovmollerOceanRegions]`` section contains a list of ``regionGroups``,
one or more of the :ref:`config_region_groups` defined in
:py:func:`geometric_features.aggregation.get_aggregator_by_name()`.

For each region group, there is a corresponding section
``[hovmoller<RegionGroup>]``, where ``<RegionGroup>`` is the name of the region
group with spaces removed.  In this section, the  ``fields`` dictionary is used
to specify a list of 3D MPAS fields to average and plot.  The key ``prefix`` is
a convenient name appended to tasks and file names to describe the field.
``mpas`` is the name of the field in MPAS ``timeSeriesStatsMonthly`` output
files.  The ``units`` are the SI units of the field to include on the plot's
color bar  and ``titleName`` is the name of the field to use in its gallery name
and on the title of the plot.

``regionNames`` is a list of regions from the full the region group or
``regionNames = ['all']`` to indicate that all regions should be used.  For
the available regions, see
`Aggregate Existing Features <http://mpas-dev.github.io/geometric_features/stable/aggregation.html>`_.

If ``computeAnomaly = True``, the plots will be the anomaly with respect to the
beginning of the time series (averaged over ``movingAverageMonths`` months).

Each field has a ``[hovmollerOceanRegions<FieldName>]`` section, where
``<FieldName>`` is the associated ``prefix`` but starting with a capital letter.
Each of these sections has a ``yLim`` option that can specify the desired depth
range.  The default is the full range.

For more details on the remaining config options, see
 * :ref:`config_region_groups`
 * :ref:`config_colormaps`
 * :ref:`config_moving_average`
 * :ref:`config_time_axis_ticks`
