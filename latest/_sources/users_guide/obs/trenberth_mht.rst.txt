Meridional Heat Transport (MHT)
===============================

Description
-----------
The Trenbert and Caron oceanic meridional heat transport is computed
by computation of energy balance of the atmosphere, adjusted to fit
physical constraints, and using two reanalysis products: the National
Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric
Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis and the European Centre for Medium-Range
Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) product. The analysis focuses on the period
from February 1985 to April 1989 when there are reliable top-of-the-atmosphere
radiation data from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment.
