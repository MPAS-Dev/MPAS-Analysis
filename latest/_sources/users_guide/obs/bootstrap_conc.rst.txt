Ice concentration: SSM/I, Bootstrap algorithm
=============================================

Description
-----------
This sea ice concentration data set was derived using measurements from
the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) on the Nimbus-7
satellite and from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) sensors on
the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's (DMSP) -F8, -F11, and -F13
satellites. Measurements from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder
(SSMIS) aboard DMSP-F17 are also included. The data set has been
generated using the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth
Observing System (AMSR-E) Bootstrap Algorithm with daily varying
tie-points. Daily (every other day prior to July 1987) and monthly data
are available for both the north and south polar regions. Data are
gridded on the SSM/I polar stereographic grid (25 x 25 km) and provided
in two-byte integer format. Data are available via FTP.
