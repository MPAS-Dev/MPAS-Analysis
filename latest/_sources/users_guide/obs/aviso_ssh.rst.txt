AVISO Absolute Dynamic Topography
=================================

Description
-----------
`NASA JPL AVISO website`_
This dataset contains absolute dynamic topography (similar to sea level
but with respect to the geoid) binned and averaged monthly on 1 degree
grids. The coverage is from October 1992 to December 2010. These data
were provided by AVISO (French space agency data provider) to support the
CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) under the World
Climate Research Program (WCRP) and was first made available via the JPL
Earth System Grid. The dynamic topography are derived from sea surface
height measured by several satellites including Envisat, TOPEX/Poseidon,
Jason-1 and OSTM/Jason-2, and referenced to the geoid. Along with this
dataset, two additional ancillary data files are included in the same
directory which contain the number of observations and standard error
co-located on the same 1 degree grids.

Release Policy
--------------
When using Ssalto/Duacs data (NRT or DT along-track Absolute Dynamic
Topography (ADT), maps of SLA geostrophic currents (MSLA UV) or maps of
ADT heights and currents (MADT H and UV), climatologies and averages of
MSLA-H), please cite: "The altimeter products were produced by
Ssalto/Duacs and distributed by Aviso, with support from Cnes
(http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/duacs/)"
