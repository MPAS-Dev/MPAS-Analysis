Roemmich-Gilson Argo Climatology
================================

Description
-----------
This new version of the Roemmich-Gilson Argo Climatology extends the
analysis of Argo-only derived potential temperature and salinity fields
through 2016. Several marginal seas and the Artic Oean have been added.
The analysis method is similar to what was descibed in the Progress In
Oceanography Roemmich and Gilson paper (2009). The only modification has
been to scale the zonal equatorial correlation of the optimal estimation
step, by 8 times, versus 4 times as in the 2009 paper. The additional
Argo data utilized in the analysis results in a longer monthly record as
well as better estimates of the mean and variability fields. Monthly
updates are available in between major yearly re-analyses.
