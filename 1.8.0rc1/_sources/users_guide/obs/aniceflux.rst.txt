Sea ice production and transport: Haumann et al 2016
====================================================

Description
-----------
This data set provides estimates of annual freshwater fluxes related to sea-ice formation from ocean freezing
and snow-ice formation, sea-ice melting, lateral transport of sea ice in the Southern Ocean over the period
1982 to 2008. It is derived from a mass balance calculation of local sea-ice volume change and divergence
from satellite data and sea-ice reconstructions. The mass balance is calculated on a daily basis and fluxes are
then integrated over the entire year, where a year is defined from March to February of the next year (i.e.
from March 1982 to February 2009). This approach combines multiple products of sea-ice concentration
(Cavalieri & Parkinson, 2008; Comiso, 1986; Meier et al., 2013), sea-ice thickness (Kurtz & Markus, 2012;
Massonnet et al., 2013; Worby et al., 2008), and sea-ice drift (Fowler et al., 2013; Kwok 2005; Schwegmann
et al., 2011). For a detailed description of the method see Haumann et al. (2016). The data set is derived to
estimate large-scale (regional to basin-scale) fluxes on an annual basis. Our confidence is reduced on a grid
cell basis, such as for single coastal polynyas, where the method and underlying data induce large, unknown
uncertainties.
